1. GPT-4 Turbo
    • Optimized for speed and cost, used for many tasks requiring higher performance.
2. GPT-4
    • High-quality, handles complex queries and tasks but is slower and costlier than Turbo.
3. GPT-3.5 Turbo
    • A fast, cost-efficient version of GPT-3.5, suitable for general tasks like chating.
4. GPT-4o
    • Multimodal (accepting text or image inputs and outputting text), and it has the same high intelligence as GPT-4 Turbo but is much more efficient
5. GPT-4o Mini
    • We recommend choosing gpt-4o-mini where you would have previously used gpt-3.5-turbo as this model is more capable and cheaper.
